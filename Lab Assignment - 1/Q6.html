with interesting subjects in marvellous colours.-->
    <div>
        I am currently taking the following classes in my current semester:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <div style='color: red'>Network Security</div>
            </li>
            Due to my keen interest in CyberSec, I took up this subject this semester and am planning to work on some
            wonderful research article on an interesting topic <br>related to the subject.
            This subject mostly deals with the different security practices and attacks.
            <li>
                <div style='color: green'>Java</div>
            </li>
            Java is one of our compulsory electives, and I am really looking forward to adding a new language to my
            arsenal.
            This subject mostly deals with Programming paradigms and OOPS concepts.
            <li>
                <div style='color: blue'>Internet and Web Programming</div>
            </li>
            I am very passionate on building stuff that is scalable, distributable and web based.
            Hence I took up this subject to explore my passion.
            This subject deals with making basic web application that involve frontend and backend.

                <div style='color: Magenta'>Building Microservices, Fine grained Systems</div>
            </li>
            Distributed systems have become more fine-grained as organizations shift from code-heavy monolithic
            applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its own set of
            problems. With lots of examples and practical advice, this expanded second edition takes a holistic view of
            the topics system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving
            microservices architectures.

            </li>
            Kevin Mitnick, the world's most celebrated hacker, now devotes his life to helping businesses and
            governments combat data thieves, cybervandals, and other malicious computer intruders. In his bestselling
            The Art of Deception, Mitnick presented fictionalized case studies that illustrated how savvy computer
            crackers use "social engineering" to compromise even the most technically secure computer systems. Now, in
            his new book, Mitnick goes one step further, offering hair-raising stories of real-life computer
            break-ins-and showing how the victims could have prevented them.

                The biggest regret right now I have is that I have an exam tomorrow, and I was too lazy to complete my
                assignment before -_-

                <div class="programming">
                    My programming skills are something like my grades, I try improving every sem and then they end up
                    like
                    my new year resolutions, lost and forgotten.<br>
                    I prefer coding in the following languages:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Python - This guy always has my back, easiest to learn, and I have been doing this since
                            class
                            8.</li>
                        <li>Golang - This sweet language helps me to build scalable stuff with excellent
                            performance(better
                            than C++ sometimes), but takes a bit long to develop compared to python.</li>
                        <li>Rust - This beast is the most scalable(better than C++ in terms of memory management and
                            concurrency) and I am trying to learn this for over two months now. Good for building
                            applications and has control over each and every grain of performance and optimization.</li>
                    </ol>
